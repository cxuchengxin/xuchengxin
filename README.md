- Unpacking Nonprofit Autonomy-Interdependence Paradox in Collaborative Relationships.

> With Mirae Kim.

> Nonprofit organizations interested in collaborating with other entities find it difficult to strike a balance between keeping their autonomy and reaping the benefits from collaborating with other organizations. Although inter-organizational collaborations come with various benefits, such as reducing competition over limited resources, participating in collaborative relationships can also damage the autonomy of individual nonprofits. Using an original survey of 275 nonprofits, we examine how various dimensions of collaborative relationships affect an individual nonprofitâ€™s autonomy. Our findings suggest that having highly specified administrative arrangements and stronger trust as well as reciprocity among partner organizations serve as critical factors to secure the autonomy of individual organizations. We also find that nonprofit organizations engaged in mostly informal relationships and in partnerships across sectors feel less threatened about maintaining their autonomy. Our post-hoc analysis further suggests that organizational autonomy is a significant antecedent for seeking more collaborations. To this end, we discuss how nonprofits can keep their organizational autonomy without giving up collaborating with other entities by strategically managing several aspects of the collaborative relationships. 

- Does Labeling COVID-19 as "Chinese Virus" Trigger Perceived Foreign Threats and Reduce the Blame?

> With Yixin Liu.

> Connecting a life-threatening crisis with geographic localities is suggested to stigmatize people from that area. However, such strategy may reduce the public blame attributable to the government because the perceived foreign threat establishes a scapegoat which transfer the blame. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigated whether the "Chinese Virus" label placed on COVID-19 may have triggered opposition to Chinese immigrants and reduced public blame attributed to the federal government during the pandemic. Through a survey experiment embedded with a list experiment approach, this study suggests a heterogeneous treatment effect of such label: although no treatment effect overall was detected, the "Chinese Virus" label led to a significant increase of perceived threat of Chinese immigrants among liberals but no influence on conservatives. However, the "Chinese Virus" label showed no effect on reducing the blame attributed to the federal government.
